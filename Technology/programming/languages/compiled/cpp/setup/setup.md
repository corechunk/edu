# Setup
## Install C++

If you want to run C++ on your own computer, you need :

- A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code. I recommend **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**
- A [compiler](https://github.com/corechunk/extras/blob/main/files/compilers/c_cpp/c_cpp_compilers.md), like GCC or Clang, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand

There are many text editors, IDE and compilers to choose from. I recommend sticking with an IDE.

## C++ IDE
---
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.

Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code.

**Note:** Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.

We will use **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)** in our tutorial, which I personally believe is a good place to start. Cause in this tutorial we will learn by `script` based compiling. So you will learn how compilation works in a deeper level. `Not just pressing a run button in an IDE but you will learn what happens under the hood.`
**[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)** It is not a full blown `IDE` nor just a `text editor`. but its something hybrid (in between).

You can find the latest version of VS Code at **[this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**.
