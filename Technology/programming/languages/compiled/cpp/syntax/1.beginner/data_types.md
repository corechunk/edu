# Data Types

In C++ there are many data types. but most common ones are given below :

`int` --> (stands for : `integer`) (stored : integer number)
`float` --> (stores : `decimal point value including integer`)
`double` --> (stores : `more decimal point valies including integer for more precision`)
`char` --> (stands for : `character`) (stores : single character only)
`string` --> (stores : multi character including line change etc. in one short: it can store multi character long texts)

`creating a variable with any of these data types means that the variable store that specific type of information.`

## Create a variable with data types
