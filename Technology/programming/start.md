# Programming Tutorials

Welcome to the Programming section! This collection offers beginner-friendly tutorials on essential programming skills for STEM learners. From writing your first program to building and managing projects, these resources are clear, practical, and accessible.

## How to Use This Section
- **Click blue links** to access available tutorials; white links indicate topics coming soon.
- If you’re new to GitHub, click blue links to read tutorials in your browser. To save all content, click the green “Code” button on the repository’s main page and select “Download ZIP” for offline use.
- Each topic has a `start.md` file with an overview, prerequisites, and subtopics.
- Use [VSCode](environments/vscode/start.md) (not a full-blown IDE nor just a text editor) to view `.md` files or follow code examples.

## Getting Started
- **Prerequisites**: Install a code editor like [VSCode](environments/vscode/start.md) (not a full-blown IDE nor just a text editor, but a lightweight, customizable tool) and compilers/interpreters (e.g., gcc for C/C++, Python for Python, bash for Bash, JDK for Java, Rust for Rust).
- **Learning Path**:
  1. Begin with [Programming Languages](languages/start.md) to master coding fundamentals.
  2. Use [Build Tools](build_tools/start.md) to compile and manage projects.
  3. Learn [Version Control](version_control/start.md) to track and collaborate on code.
  4. Set up [Development Environments](environments/start.md) for efficient coding.
  5. Explore [Debugging and Testing](debugging_testing/start.md) to ensure code quality.
  6. Apply [Project Management](project_management/start.md) for organizing projects.
  7. Automate tasks with [Scripting and Automation](scripting_automation/start.md).
- **Tips for Beginners**: Start with the [VSCode](environments/vscode/start.md) tutorial to set up a versatile coding environment, and practice debugging to catch errors early.
